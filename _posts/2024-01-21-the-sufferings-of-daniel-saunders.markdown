**This pocket-sized volume is not really a diary as it was compiled not during, but only after the author’s journey across the Sultanate of Oman in 1792. But we can hardly hold it against him: having been cast ashore on the coast of Dhofar with 33 other crewmen, Saunders' overland journey to Muscat was a brutal endeavour of more than 800 kilometres and characterised by robberies and starvation, sunburn blisters “from our heads to our feet” and skin-burrowing insects — along the way, Death came for many.**

Daniel Saunders jr. was born in Salem, Massachusetts, on March 4, 1772, as the second child of Daniel Saunders and Sarah Peale in a sea-faring family [^1]. His father had crossed the oceans many times during voyages to Africa, the Indies, and the Continent both as a mate and, later, as a captain; his brother Philip died at sea. 

On 28 April, 1792, the Commerce left Madras for Bombay, on the other side of the Indian Peninsula. The captain’s navigational skills, however, were a poor match for the hostile monsoon currents. After days of “ſtrong gales of wind from the ſouthward and weſtward,” the ship’s crew observed they were closing in on a coastal area and started making soundings, to no avail: “Our captain, not at all alarmed, but imagining himſelf once more on the coaſt of Malabar, ordered the ſhip to be ſteered N.N.W. as he ſuppoſed for Bombay” — instead, on 10 July, 1792, the ship ran aground some two or three miles off the coast of Dhofar, the mountainous southeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula.

The 'Advertisement' on the verso of the title-page details how the publication came about:

> "It is almoſt unnecessary to obſerve, that the occurrences related in the following pages could not have been written during the painful journey in which they happened. The Writer, after his arrival at Muſkat, noted down the events which took place from day to day during his travels, as accurately as he could collect them from the recollection of himſelf and his fellow ſufferers, & by that means was able to form a connected JOURNAL from the time of the ſhipwreck till his arrival at a place of ſafety; which he did ſolely for the ſatisfaction of himſelf and his friends. Its publication is in conſequence of repeated ſolicitations for that purpoſe, ſince his return to Salem. And he ſincerely hopes, that no mariner may ever have occaſion to relate misfortunes and ſufferings like thoſe which befel the Company of the Ship Commerce."

Of the 34 people on board, XX died, XX disappeared, and 1 was - in all likelihood - enslaved.

> “In the fore part of the day, some of the company were driven to the sad necessity of making use of a sustenance, to save them from perishing, too disagreeable to be named.”
