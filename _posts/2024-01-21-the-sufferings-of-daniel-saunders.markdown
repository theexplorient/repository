### Introduction
_This pocket-sized volume is not really a diary as it was compiled not during, but only after the author’s journey across the Sultanate of Oman in 1792. But we can hardly hold it against him: having been cast ashore on the coast of Dhofar with 33 other crewmen, his overland journey to Muscat was a brutal endeavour of more than 800 kilometres and characterised by robberies and starvation, sunburn blisters “from our heads to our feet” and skin-burrowing insects — along the way, Death came for many._

> “In the fore part of the day, some of the company were driven to the sad necessity of making use of a sustenance, to save them from perishing, too disagreeable to be named.” 

Daniel Saunders jr. was born on March 4, 1772, as the second child of Daniel Saunders and Sarah Peale in a sea-faring family [^1]. His father had crossed the oceans many times during voyages to Africa, the Indies, and the Continent both as a mate and, later, as a captain; his brother Philip died at sea.
